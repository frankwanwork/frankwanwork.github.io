			<li>
				<b>File Naming Convention:</b>
				<p>

				</p>
				<p>
					For example, if you are answering Question(q) 4 from Assignment(Hw) 2, the file name should <b>EXACTLY</b> be Hw2_q4_code.c, failing which, you will lose points. See <a href="Grading Rubrics.html">Grading rubrics</a>.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>
					Before submitting, make sure that you have strictly followed the file naming conventions given above in 1.
